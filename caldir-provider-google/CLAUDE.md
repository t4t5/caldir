## Design Decisions

### User-Provided OAuth Credentials

We don't embed Google Cloud credentials in the app. Users create their own Google Cloud project and provide their own client ID and secret.

This is more friction (~10 minutes of setup), but it means:
- No dependency on any third party
- No "unverified app" warnings (it's your own app)
- No single point of failure if a developer's project gets banned
- True independence — the caldir philosophy is about owning your data
